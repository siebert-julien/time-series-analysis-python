# Contributing Guidelines

If you're reading this, it means that 1) this repository is probably missing something interesting, 
and 2) you're possibly considering adding things to it; 
or you just like reading the contribution guidelines, which is also cool.

First of all, thank you very much for being here. 
We wrote these guidelines to make life easier for everyone (contributors, reviewers, maintainers, etc.).
Take a look at it, make the best of it, and open an issue!

## Adding a new package

The easiest way is probably to open an issue. There is no formal template for this (yet), please name the package and check the original article [Siebert2021](README.md#citation.siebert2021) for inclusion and exclusion criteria. 

## Adding a new category (task, data preparation, evaluation, documentation, datasets)

The easiest way is probably to open an issue. There is no formal template for this (yet), please mention why the new category makes sense.

## Reviewing the listed packages

We plan to review the list of packages every 6 month. Contributions are welcomed.
