# Time series analysis tasks

Time series analysis tasks are formally defined in the literature in time series data-mining reviews like [Fakhazari2017](#citation.fakhrazari2017),[Esling2012](#citation.esling2012),[Fu2011](#citation.fu2011),[Keogh2003](#citation.keogh2003).
Esling and Agon also define "implementation components" [Esling2012](#citation.esling2012)

## Tasks

### Indexing (query by content)

Given a time series and some similarity measure, find the nearest matching time series.

### Clustering

Find groups (clusters) of similar time series.

### Classification

Assign a time series to a predefined class.

### Segmentation (Summarization)

Create an accurate approximation of a time series, by reducing its dimensionality while retaining its essential features.

### Forecasting (Prediction)

Given a time series dataset up to a given time $t_n$, forecast the next values.

### Anomaly Detection

Find abnormal data points or subsequences (also called discords).


### Motif Discovery

Find every subsequences (called motif) that appears recurrently in a time series.

### Rules Discovery (Rule mining)

Find the rules that may govern associations between sets of time series or subsequences \cite{Fu.2011,Fakhrazari.2017} 

## Implementation components

### preprocessing 

Examples: normalization, filtering noise, removing outliers, or imputing missing values.

### representation (e.g., dimensionality reduction, finding fundamental shape characteristics)

### similarity measures

### indexing schemes
